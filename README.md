# play-scala-slick-example

This project demonstrates how to create a simple CRUD application with [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) and [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.1/) using [Play-Slick](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick).

It uses two small 'glue' libraries [play-refined](https://github.com/kwark/play-refined) and [slick-refined](https://github.com/kwark/slick-refined] to show how you can easily add support for Refinement types to such an application.

This project is/was used as a demo for my ScalaX 2017 presentation [Refined in practice](https://github.com/kwark/refined-in-practice)
